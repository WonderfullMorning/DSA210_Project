# DSA210_Project

# Motivation
This project is driven by the observation that complex diseases, such as Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), exhibit discernible probabilistic patterns correlated with various health and lifestyle factors.

# Objectives
The core motivation is twofold: to demonstrate the capacity of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform sophisticated probabilistic risk stratification by identifying subtle, high-dimensional patterns within health data, and to apply this methodology specifically to CAD.

By successfully training an LLM for early risk assessment of CAD, the system can be leveraged to conduct granular analysis on the influence of specific lifestyle and environmental variables. This analysis will not only enhance predictive accuracy but also yield actionable insights into modifiable risk factors, providing a powerful tool for personalized preventive healthcare and public health intervention strategies.
