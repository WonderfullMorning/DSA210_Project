# Project Overwiev
This project is driven by the observation that complex diseases, such as Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), exhibit discernible probabilistic patterns correlated with various health and lifestyle factors.

The core objective is to develop a robust, data-driven framework for CAD risk prediction. This involves a comprehensive methodological approach: first, comparing and benchmarking different machine learning algorithms against each other and against the selected Large Language Model (LLM) approach for superior performance. Rigorous performance evaluation metrics will be applied across models. Furthermore, the study will conduct a comparative analysis of two distinct health datasets to ensure model generalization and robustness. The primary goal is to leverage the chosen model to perform sophisticated probabilistic risk stratification for CAD and, crucially, to identify the most influential risk factors and lifestyle variables that serve as key determinants of the disease. This will translate complex data into actionable insights for personalized preventive healthcare.


# Objectives

The successful execution of this project is defined by the delivery of the following concrete artifacts:

1.Optimized CAD Prediction Model: A highly performant machine learning model (including the LLM-based approach) capable of accurate probabilistic risk prediction for Coronary Artery Disease.

2.Comparative Model Benchmarking Report: A detailed analysis comparing the performance (e.g., AUC, precision, recall, F1-score) of the LLM approach against multiple traditional classification algorithms.

3.Risk Factor Importance Atlas: A comprehensive identification and ranking of the most salient health and lifestyle factors contributing to CAD risk, derived using explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

4.Dataset Generalization Study: A report detailing the structural and predictive differences observed between the two utilized health datasets, validating the model's robustness and generalizability.

5.Actionable Health Insights: A documented set of findings that translate complex model outputs into practical recommendations for preventative health measures and lifestyle adjustments.
