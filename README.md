# DSA210_Project

# Motivation
This project is driven by the observation that complex diseases, such as Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), exhibit discernible probabilistic patterns correlated with various health and lifestyle factors.

The core motivation is twofold: to demonstrate the capacity of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform sophisticated probabilistic risk stratification by identifying subtle, high-dimensional patterns within health data, and to apply this methodology specifically to CAD.

By successfully training an LLM for early risk assessment of CAD, the system can be leveraged to conduct granular analysis on the influence of specific lifestyle and environmental variables. This analysis will not only enhance predictive accuracy but also yield actionable insights into modifiable risk factors, providing a powerful tool for personalized preventive healthcare and public health intervention strategies.


# Objectives
Key Project Deliverables

The successful execution of this project is defined by the delivery of the following concrete artifacts:

1 Optimized CAD Prediction Model: A highly performant machine learning model (including the LLM-based approach) capable of accurate probabilistic risk prediction for Coronary Artery Disease.

2 Comparative Model Benchmarking Report: A detailed analysis comparing the performance (e.g., AUC, precision, recall, F1-score) of the LLM approach against multiple traditional classification algorithms.

3 Risk Factor Importance Atlas: A comprehensive identification and ranking of the most salient health and lifestyle factors contributing to CAD risk, derived using explainable AI (XAI) techniques.

4 Dataset Generalization Study: A report detailing the structural and predictive differences observed between the two utilized health datasets, validating the model's robustness and generalizability.

5 Actionable Health Insights: A documented set of findings that translate complex model outputs into practical recommendations for preventative health measures and lifestyle adjustments.
